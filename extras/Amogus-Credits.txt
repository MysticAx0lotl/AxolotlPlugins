BreadoWebTech for their Quotes plugin (https://github.com/BreadoWebTech/breadoplugs), which I used as a base
Chyno Deluxe @ CodePen for their random GIF generator (https://codepen.io/ChynoDeluxe/pen/WGQzWW), which I used as reference on how to interact with the Giphy API
[REDACTED], [REDACTED], @beef, and @sean of the official Vendetta Discord server for helping a complete JavaScript noob to successfully write and deploy their first JS project
@Wing of the Vendetta Discord server for sharing the code to let me interface with Discord's GIF API instead of having to pass my gif request through, like, 3 different APIs.
You, for downloading this goofy meme plugin!
